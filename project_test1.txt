This is seen as a fundamental enabler for nano-scale networked devices. The heterogeneity of the biological environments that can host nano-scale communications has produced different proposals (e.g. neuronal networks, molecular diffusion, flow-based carrier mobility) analyzed by means of different research approaches and tools (different analytical models, simulators, lab experiments). For this reason, the need of integrating research activities at an EU level has emerged. The main objective of the CIRCLE is to integrate islands of heterogeneous research activities in a common research framework. The nature of the proposal is therefore strategic for the EU research objectives, highly interdisciplinary, inclusive of any input coming from any research activities that can contribute to identifying a research roadmap for the future years and feasible future exploitation plans.\n\nIn the short term, CIRCLE will facilitate the creation of an EU wide Molecular Communications (CIRCLE) forum and provide a support infrastructure for coordination of research across Europe. In the medium term, it will foster knowledge sharing via the CIRCLE forum and a dedicated web portal. This will focus on the sharing of both research methodologies and simulation code repositories. It will establish expert working groups in different research topics within the Molecular Communications domain and develop strategic Roadmaps for both academic research and industry involvement. In the long term, CIRCLE will push the Roadmaps at a Member State and EU level to ensure Molecular Communications research converges rapidly towards feasible products of interest in the marketplace.","title":"Coordinating European Research on Molecular Communications"}

The proposal gathers four IMTA labs including open offshore (Ireland, Scotland), flow-through inshore (South Africa) and recirculation inshore (Brazil) systems and one prospective IMTA lab (Argentina), focusing on a regional challenge-based perspective, including fish, mollusc, echinoderm, crustacean and algae species. ASTRAL will increase circularity by 50-60% compared to monoculture baseline aquaculture and will provide a circular business model, boosting revenue diversification for aquaculture producers increasing profitability by at least 30%. New and improved innovative technology will be developed, including biosensors, sensors, IoT and an AI data analytics platform to be validated at IMTA labs at TRL 5. Potential environmental and climatic risks for Northern and Southern Atlantic regions will be addressed, delivering a monitoring programme and recommendations for Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), pathogens and microplastics. ASTRAL will deliver an ambitious and gender-sensitive human capital development plan (HUCAP) which will improve professional skills and create a highly trained workforce. ASTRAL will share, integrate and co-generate knowledge, technology, practices and efforts with and for society, oriented towards pro-poor and gender-sensitive development. A collaborative ecosystem will be provided within the project framework bringing together and connecting industrial partners, SMEs, scientists, policy makers, social representatives and other relevant stakeholders promoting data exchange, knowledge sharing and business opportunities.","title":"All Atlantic Ocean Sustainable, Profitable and Resilient Aquaculture"}
